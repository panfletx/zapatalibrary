Welcome! _Facets_ is the second Jekyll theme for [Wax sites](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/). _Facets_ allows users to browse through a collection using facets, or filters. When we are browsing through a collection of cultural artifacts, we often want to reduce the number of objects in front of us to a small collection that fits a very specific criteria. Faceted browsing is a form of browsing that allows you to do just that using filters you select. In Facets this can be achieved using drop-down menus where you can select the categories you want to browse by.

This template is open source. To use it for your small collection and exhibit simply replace our content with yours. To learn more visit our ["About"]({{site.baseurl}}/about/) page and our ["How to"]({{site.baseurl}}/learning/) page. If you know what you're doing, and you're ready to jump right in, then go ahead and...
